				<h1>Welcome to the Documentation of Nova Engine</h1>
				<p><strong>Nova Engine</strong> is a completely free game engine made by a solo developer—powered by caffeine, late nights, and too much free time.</p>
				<h2>What is Nova Engine?</h2>
				<p><strong>Nova Engine</strong> is an in-development game engine. It uses a class-based system for scene objects. As of right now, I would not recommend trying to actually make a game with Nova Engine. It's still very early in development and is mostly just fun to play around with.</p>
				<p>The Documentation (just like the engine itself) is also still in development. There may be pages missing for some things. Make sure to write a bug report for any pages that are missing.</p>
				<h2>Get Involved</h2>
				<p>If (when) you encounter any bugs, I would greatly appreciate it if you report them at this <a href="https://discord.gg/s7Axx58VDv" target="_blank">Discord server</a>. There's a channel dedicated to bug reports, and a Nova Engine tag.</p>
