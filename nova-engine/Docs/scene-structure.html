				<h1>Scene Structure</h1>
				<p>Scenes are defined using a text-based format. Each object is defined by its class type and properties. Example:</p>
				<pre># you can use # for comments
[FileImage]
tag = "image_asset"
filepath = "ProjectFolder/path/to/your/image"
[/FileImage]

[Script]
tag = "Rotater"
filepath = "ProjectFolder/path/to/your/script"
[/Script]

# as a good practice you should put your asset dependencies
# at the top of your scene file

[Sprite2D]
tag = "sprite"
image = "image_asset"
position = Vector2(200, 500)
[/Sprite2D]

[Object2D]
# by default this objects tag is its index in the scene file (3)
script = "Rotater"
parent = "sprite"
[/Object2D]

# any objects that arent added as a child of another object
# go on to the root of the scene

[Camera2D]
[/Camera2D]

# ^ adds a basic camera 2D at 0, 0
</pre>
